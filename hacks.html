    <h2>Hacks and Projects</h2>
    <p>
    A sample of some of my pet programs and projects. I currently have an 
    obsession for Python, though I've yet to make the transition to Python 3.
    <br /><br />
    Hackathons I've attended include HackNY and Hack Princeton. I've also been
    very fortunate to be a part of <a
    href="http://www.google.com/edu/programs/android-camp/">
    Google's Android Camp</a> - you should all apply! <br /><br />
    Join me this fall for our very own Rutgers hackathon,
    <a href="http://www.hackru.org/">Hack RU</a>! It's a semi-annual hackathon
    open to all students, held every fall and spring semester. This year's
    event will be held the weekend of October 12th in the Douglass Campus
    Center. For more information, see the official hackathon page, or visit
    <a href="http://usacs.rutgers.edu/">the Rutgers USACS website</a>.
    You can also browse all my hackathon pictures

    in my Facebook album</a>. <br /><br />
    For all of my open source code and projects, you can see
    <a href="https://github.com/ksuarz">my GitHub</a>, or browse my
    hackathon entries

    See you at the next hackathon!

    <h3>(100) Days of Python</h3>
    <script src="http://gist.github.com/ksuarz/6409388.js"></script>
    <p>
    Learning how to Python, one mini-project at a time. I'm really far behind
    from the full hundred... maybe one day I'll finally make enough. It's
    also all in Python 2. Hopefully I'll get around to learning all of the
    nifty new Python 3 stuff.
    <br /> <br />

    You can find the source on GitHub
    <a href="https://www.github.com/ksuarz/hundred-days">here</a>.

    <h3>Punchcard Love</h3>

    <p>
    A five-man hack for <a href="http://hackny.org">HackNY</a>. It's
    an Arduino LED light-sensor that reads custom punchcards that
    send texts, fetches the New York Times, and tweets. Surprisingly, we won the
    Twilio API prize! It's the
    new hipster way to use your computer. <br /> <br />

    You can check out
    <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/spring-2013-hackny-student-hackathon/hacks/punch-card-love">the HackerLeague project</a>,
    or browse the source code for the Arduino LED sensor <a href="https://github.com/ksuarz/arduino-punchcard-reader">on GitHub</a>.

    <h3>Celebrity Sticky Notes</h3>
    <p>
    A gang-of-five hack for
    <a href="http://hackprinceton.com/">Hack Princeton</a>. Uses
    the OpenTok API, facial-recognition, and CSS black-magic
    transforms to render a sticky note on your forehead just so you
    can guess what's written on each other's heads. We won the OpenTok API prize
    by default... some glory is better than none, I suppose.<br /> <br />

    It was never fully finished in 24 hours, but you can peruse the
    <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackprinceton-spring-2013/hacks/whose-name-is-it-anyway">HackerLeague page</a>
    and the <a href="https://github.com/indraneel/Celebrity">source code</a>.
