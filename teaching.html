      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
      I am a teaching assistant for <strong>198:170 - Computer Applications
        for Business</strong> for Fall 2013. If you'd like a special permission
        number, you'll have to contact your professor or apply online at the
        <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu">Rutgers Computer Science page</a>.
        Currently I've got the following sections:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Section 4</strong> <br />
            Tuesday, 3:05-4:00, College Avenue Satellite Lab
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Section 9</strong> <br />
            Tuesday, 10:35-11:30, ARC 118
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Previously, I've also been a peer leader for 198:111 - Intro to Computer
        Science. Feel free to ask me general computer science questions, or come
        hang out with the rest of the Computer Science crew at the CAVE on the
        second floor of the Hill Center.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting Code</h3>
      <p>
        Important code and other examples done in class will be posted on Sakai.
        It's also all version-controlled in a Git repository. If you'd like to
        keep up-to-date with all the latest stuff, you can clone my repository:
        <script src="http://gist.github.com/ksuarz/6409539.js"></script>
        <!-- TODO : alternative if the gist doesn't link (i.e. mobile) -->
        If you use Mac or Windows, let me know and I can give you more specific
        instructions for your operating system.
